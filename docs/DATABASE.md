# Database

manoverboard.ai uses **PostgreSQL** for multi-user SaaS: row-level isolation per account,
session auth, and a central database shared across app instances.

## TL;DR

- Storage is **PostgreSQL** via the `pg` driver and `DATABASE_URL`.
- Each user has their own projects, goals, and daily log — scoped by `user_id`.
- Auth uses email/password + bearer session tokens (not a shared dashboard password).
- Telegram is linked per-user via a one-time `/link CODE` command.

## Connection

Set `DATABASE_URL` to your Postgres connection string. On Railway, add a Postgres
service and reference `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` on your app service.

For local Postgres without SSL:

```
DATABASE_SSL=false
```

## Schema

### `users`

| column | type | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | SERIAL | PK |
| `email` | TEXT | unique, required |
| `password_hash` | TEXT | bcrypt |
| `name` | TEXT | nullable |
| `telegram_chat_id` | TEXT | unique, nullable — linked Telegram chat |
| `telegram_link_code` | TEXT | nullable — one-time link code from dashboard |
| `daily_time` | TEXT | `HH:MM` for morning nudge |
| `checkin_time` | TEXT | `HH:MM` for evening check-in |
| `timezone` | TEXT | IANA timezone for cron |
| `stall_days` | INTEGER | days without progress = stalling |
| `last_daily_nudge_date` | DATE | prevents duplicate daily sends |
| `last_checkin_nudge_date` | DATE | prevents duplicate check-in sends |

### `sessions`

Bearer tokens for dashboard auth. Expire after 30 days.

### `projects`, `goals`, `daily_log`

Same columns as before, plus `user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)`.
All queries are scoped by `user_id` for row-level isolation.

## Multi-instance / SaaS

Postgres is the right choice when you need:

- **Multiple users** with per-account data isolation
- **Multiple app instances** writing concurrently (Railway replicas, rolling deploys)
- **Managed backups and replication** (Railway Postgres handles this)
- **Central DB** reachable from web, bot, and cron workers
